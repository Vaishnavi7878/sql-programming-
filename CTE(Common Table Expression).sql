with highsalary as(select * from Employeess where salary>75000) 
select * from highsalary;

--  Use CTE to find average salary by department and list departments with average salary > 75000.
with deptsalary as(select department, avg(salary) as avgsalary from Employeess
group by department 
having avgsalary>75000)
select * from deptsalary ;

with EmpManager as (select e.EmpName as Employeess ,m.EmpName as manager 
from Employeess e 
left join Employeess m on e.EmpID = m.ManagerID)
select * from  EmpManager;



--  Find employees who work in the same department as their manager
with samedept as 
(select e.EmpName ,e.EmpID, e.ManagerID from Employeess e
join Employeess m on e.EmpID = M.ManagerID 
where e.department = m.department)
